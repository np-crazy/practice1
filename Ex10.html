	Raigad, situated in the Raigad district of Maharashtra, India, is a hill fort located in the town of Mahad. It is one of the strongest fortresses on the Deccan Plateau and was historically referred to as Rairee or Rairy fort.[1]
    Chhatarpati Shivaji Maharaj, the Maratha ruler, along with the Chief Engineer Hiroji Indulkar, oversaw the construction and development of various buildings and structures within Raigad. In 1674, after being crowned the king of the Maratha kingdom, Shivaji chose Raigad as his capital. Under his reign, the Maratha Empire expanded to encompass a significant portion of western and central India.[2]
